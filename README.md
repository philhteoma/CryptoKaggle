To run the notebook, download the kaggle data and extract it in the main folder. All the csv's should end up in the folder "g-research-crypto-forecasting". Put them there if they aren't.

Pretty sure we can't legally upload the data to github - the gitignore should handle that. There isn't a blanket band on CSV's though (in case we use our own later), so keep all the data in the g-research-crypto-forecasting folder for now, or add your own exceptions to the gitignore
